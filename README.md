## Introduction

This repository is dedicated to monitoring the status of the reproducibility packages for the Policy Research Working Paper series of the World Bank. The repository serves two primary purposes:

1. It hosts the issues originating from our [GitHub project](https://github.com/orgs/dime-worldbank/projects/4) that manages the reproducibility initiative. All management tasks related to PRWP will be conducted here.

2. The repository contains a file that provides step-by-step instructions on how to review a package. These instructions can be accessed [here](https://github.com/dime-worldbank/prwp-reproducibility-int/blob/main/reproducibility-reviewer-protocol.md).


## Project Management Process 

 1. Arrival of Reproducibility Package
 
 2. Upload to OneDrive (Luise/Mer)
- [ ] Upload the received reproducibility package to the designated folder in OneDrive.

 3. Update GitHub Table (Luise/Mer)
- [ ] Navigate to the table in the repository and update with relevant details.
- [ ] Convert the table entry to a GitHub issue to notify the assignee. This action will trigger an email to the assignee.
- [ ] Confirm with the assignee that they will run the package.
- [ ] Add the DIME label in case it is a DIME paper.  
 
4. Review
- [ ] The assignee will start by accessing the step-by-step guide linked below for reviewing a package.
- [ ] Follow the instructions provided for package review: [Reviewing a package step-by-step guide](https://github.com/dime-worldbank/prwp-reproducibility-int/blob/main/reproducibility-reviewer-protocol.md).
- [ ] Throughout the review process, the assignee must track the time spent at each step. This time should be documented in the respective GitHub issue for the package:
  - Time spent during the first run:
  - Time spent reviewing stability:
  - Time spent reviewing results:
  - Time spent drafting the report:

 5. Monitor Project Status (Luise/Mer)
- [ ] Monitor the GitHub issues and the status updates provided by the assignees.
- [ ] Make sure to monitor the time spent by the assignee in each task. This will be documented inside the issue for the package, and add the final time to the column of the package.
- [ ] If needed, offer assistance or answer queries related to the reproducibility package.
- [ ] Once the issue is resolved, ensure the table in the project and the GitHub issue reflect the correct status, and that needed information is there (time spent, person, if it ran and reproduced, any modifications made).

## Potential Labels

These labels can be used in GitHub issues to effectively categorize and manage the different aspects and stages of the reproducibility packages. Assignees can add labels to their issues to better track them. 
These are the current labels, but if you feel like a label is missing it can be added. 

- **bug**: Something isn't working
- **Data/Code embargo**: The package is ready to publish but has been embargoed
- **dime paper**: This is a dime paper
- **good first issue**: Issue to open and start tracking time/process
- **help wanted**: Extra attention is needed
- **pending data publication**: The package is published on RRR, pending follow-up to see if data has been published on MDL.
- **pending URL/DOI**: The package has been published, but the URL/DOI for the publication is missing in RRR.
- **question**: Further information is requested
- **working on publication**: Currently working on metadata
